### Facade Pattern:
The Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by external clients. The key goal of this pattern is simplification.

### Use-Case for Book Factory:
Consider our book production company has multiple complex subsystems, such as:

- Book Production
- Printing
- Inventory Management
- A Main wanting to order a batch of books to be produced, printed, and added to inventory would have to interact with all these subsystems, which can be cumbersome. Using the Facade pattern, we can provide a simplified interface to clients so they can perform these tasks without needing to understand the underlying complexities.



**BookProductionFacade class:** This class will provide simplified methods to clients, such as produceAndAddBooksToInventory.
