# Facade Design Pattern

## Introduction
The Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by hiding its complexities. The pattern is particularly useful when a system is complex or when there are multiple dependent subsystems.

In this implementation, the Facade pattern is used to simplify the book production process, which might involve various subsystems like book production, printing, and inventory management.

## Classes Involved
1. **BookProductionFacade (Class)**: Provides a simplified interface to the complex book production subsystem. The class encapsulates the complexities involved in producing a book, printing it, and adding it to the inventory.

## How it works
The `BookProductionFacade` class offers a method `produceAndAddBooksToInventory` that clients can use without needing to understand the intricacies of the entire book production process. Internally, this method handles the creation of a book, its printing using a specified technique, and the addition of the produced books to the inventory.

## Conclusion
The Facade pattern simplifies the interface for clients by providing a unified high-level interface to a subsystem, thereby decoupling clients from subsystem components. In our context, it allows clients to easily produce books without getting into the details of the book production process.

## Facade Pattern:
The Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by external clients. The key goal of this pattern is simplification.

## Use-Case for Book Factory:
Consider our book production company has multiple complex subsystems, such as:

- Book Production
- Printing
- Inventory Management
- A Main wanting to order a batch of books to be produced, printed, and added to inventory would have to interact with all these subsystems, which can be cumbersome. Using the Facade pattern, we can provide a simplified interface to clients so they can perform these tasks without needing to understand the underlying complexities.



**BookProductionFacade class:** This class will provide simplified methods to clients, such as produceAndAddBooksToInventory.
