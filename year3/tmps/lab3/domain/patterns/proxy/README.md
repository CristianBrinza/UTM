## Proxy Pattern:
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. The proxy could add some functionality, like lazy initialization, logging, access control, or remote access, among other things.

The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is used when we want to add some additional responsibilities to the actual object, like access control, logging, and lazy initialization.

In this implementation, the Proxy pattern is used to control access to digital books. A user can only read a digital book if they have the appropriate license.

## Use-Case for Book Factory:
Let's consider that our book factory has a digital library where users can read books. However, before giving access to a book, we need to check if the user has a valid license to read it. We can use the Proxy pattern to implement this.



- **DigitalBook interface:** An interface that defines a method read().
- **RealDigitalBook class:** Implements the DigitalBook interface and represents the actual book.
- **DigitalBookProxy class:** Also implements the DigitalBook interface and controls access to the RealDigitalBook.
- The **DigitalBookProx** will check for a valid license before allowing the user to read the book.

## Classes Involved
1. **DigitalBook (Interface)**: This interface sets the contract for any class that wants to act as a digital book. It has a `read()` method to simulate reading the book.
2. **RealDigitalBook (Class)**: This is the actual class that represents a digital book. It contains the logic to simulate loading and reading a digital book.
3. **DigitalBookProxy (Class)**: This is the proxy class that controls access to the `RealDigitalBook`. It checks if the user has a license to read the digital book before granting access.

## How it works
When a user tries to read a digital book through the `DigitalBookProxy`, the proxy first checks if the user has a license. If the user has the license, the proxy either loads the `RealDigitalBook` (if it's not already loaded) and allows the user to read it. If the user doesn't have a license, access is denied, and a message is displayed.

## Conclusion
The Proxy pattern allows for more control over the access and operations of an object. It is especially useful when we want to add additional responsibilities to the actual object without modifying its code.
