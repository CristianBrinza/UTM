### Proxy Pattern:
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. The proxy could add some functionality, like lazy initialization, logging, access control, or remote access, among other things.

### Use-Case for Book Factory:
Let's consider that our book factory has a digital library where users can read books. However, before giving access to a book, we need to check if the user has a valid license to read it. We can use the Proxy pattern to implement this.



- **DigitalBook interface:** An interface that defines a method read().
- **RealDigitalBook class:** Implements the DigitalBook interface and represents the actual book.
- **DigitalBookProxy class:** Also implements the DigitalBook interface and controls access to the RealDigitalBook.
- The **DigitalBookProx** will check for a valid license before allowing the user to read the book.
