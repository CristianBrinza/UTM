### Flyweight Pattern:
The Flyweight pattern is used to reduce the number of objects created, decrease memory footprint, and increase performance by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. The pattern is particularly useful when a large number of objects need to be created and they share a lot of information.

### Use-Case for Book Factory:
Consider the case where the book factory needs to produce a large number of books that have shared attributes, such as genre or author. Instead of creating a new instance for each attribute every time a book is produced, the Flyweight pattern can be used to reuse existing instances.



- **AttributeFactory:** This factory will produce shared attributes (like genre or author) and will store them for reuse.
- Update the **Book** class to utilize the AttributeFactory for getting genre and author instances.


```java

public class Book {
    private String title;
    private Author author;
    private Genre genre;
    // ... (rest of the attributes)

    // Constructor now takes an AttributeFactory to get genre and author instances
    public Book(String title, String authorName, String genreName, String isbn, double price, 
                PrintTechnique printTechnique, AttributeFactory attributeFactory) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = attributeFactory.getAuthor(authorName);
        this.genre = attributeFactory.getGenre(genreName);
        // ... (rest of the initialization)
    }

    // ... (rest of the class)
}
```
