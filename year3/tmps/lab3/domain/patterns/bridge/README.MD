## Introduction
The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. This pattern involves an interface or abstract class acting as a bridge which makes the functionality of concrete classes independent from interface implementer classes. The two layers of abstraction and implementation can evolve separately without depending on each other.

In this implementation, the Bridge pattern is used to abstract out various printing techniques like digital print, screen print, and lithography.

## Classes Involved
1. **PrintTechnique (Interface)**: This interface represents the abstraction for various printing techniques. It defines a method `print()` which simulates the printing of content.
2. **DigitalPrint (Class)**: A concrete implementation of the `PrintTechnique` interface, simulating digital printing.
3. **ScreenPrint (Class)**: Another concrete implementation of the `PrintTechnique` interface, simulating screen printing.
4. **Lithography (Class)**: A concrete implementation of the `PrintTechnique` interface, simulating lithographic printing.

## How it works
The `PrintTechnique` interface serves as the abstraction that various printing techniques implement. Each concrete implementation simulates a specific type of printing. For instance, `DigitalPrint` simulates digital printing, and `ScreenPrint` simulates screen printing. This allows adding new printing techniques or modifying existing ones without affecting the client code that uses these printing techniques.

## Conclusion
The Bridge pattern allows separation of concerns by decoupling an abstraction from its implementation. In our context, it allows representing various printing techniques independently of the specific details of how each printing technique works.
