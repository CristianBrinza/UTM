## Decorator Pattern:
The Decorator pattern allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. It involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components. Decorator classes mirror the type of the components they decorate but add or override behavior.

### Use-Case for Book Factory:
Imagine we want to offer special editions of books. These special editions could be hardcovers, include author signatures, or have bonus content. Instead of creating a new class for each combination of special features, we can use the Decorator pattern to add these features to books dynamically.

We'll create:

- **BookDecorator abstract class:** An abstract class that implements the BookComponent interface and has a reference to a BookComponent. This will be the base for our decorators.
- Decorator classes like **HardcoverDecorator**, **SignatureDecorator**, and **BonusContentDecorator**: These classes will extend **BookDecorator** and add additional features to the book.Represents a collection of books (or other collections) and also implements the BookComponent interface.


### BookDecorator Abstract Class:
This is an abstract decorator class that implements the BookComponent interface and holds a reference to a BookComponent. Any concrete decorator will extend this class and add or override behavior.

### HardcoverDecorator:
This decorator adds a hardcover feature to a book. It increases the price by an additional cost for the hardcover.

### SignatureDecorator:
This decorator adds an author's signature feature to a book, increasing its price slightly.

### BonusContentDecorator:
This decorator adds bonus content to a book, making the book slightly more expensive.
