## Introduction
The Decorator pattern allows adding new functionalities to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects called decorators. This pattern creates a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components. The decorator classes mirror the type of the components they decorate but add or override behavior.

In this implementation, the Decorator pattern is used to dynamically add features like bonus content, author's signature, and hardcover to books.

## Classes Involved
1. **BookDecorator (Abstract Class)**: This is an abstract decorator class that implements the `BookComponent` interface. It serves as a base class for all concrete decorators.
2. **BonusContentDecorator (Class)**: This is a concrete decorator that adds bonus content to a book.
3. **SignatureDecorator (Class)**: This is a concrete decorator that adds an author's signature to a book.
4. **HardcoverDecorator (Class)**: This is a concrete decorator that adds a hardcover to a book.

## How it works
The decorator classes wrap around the original book component. Each decorator adds its specific feature to the book. For example, `BonusContentDecorator` adds bonus content, and `SignatureDecorator` adds an author's signature. The decorators can be combined in any order to create various combinations of features for a book.

## Conclusion
The Decorator pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. In our context, it allows adding features to books without changing the book's core functionality or creating numerous subclasses.






## Decorator Pattern:
The Decorator pattern allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. It involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components. Decorator classes mirror the type of the components they decorate but add or override behavior.

### Use-Case for Book Factory:
Imagine we want to offer special editions of books. These special editions could be hardcovers, include author signatures, or have bonus content. Instead of creating a new class for each combination of special features, we can use the Decorator pattern to add these features to books dynamically.

We'll create:

- **BookDecorator abstract class:** An abstract class that implements the BookComponent interface and has a reference to a BookComponent. This will be the base for our decorators.
- Decorator classes like **HardcoverDecorator**, **SignatureDecorator**, and **BonusContentDecorator**: These classes will extend **BookDecorator** and add additional features to the book.Represents a collection of books (or other collections) and also implements the BookComponent interface.


### BookDecorator Abstract Class:
This is an abstract decorator class that implements the BookComponent interface and holds a reference to a BookComponent. Any concrete decorator will extend this class and add or override behavior.

### HardcoverDecorator:
This decorator adds a hardcover feature to a book. It increases the price by an additional cost for the hardcover.

### SignatureDecorator:
This decorator adds an author's signature feature to a book, increasing its price slightly.

### BonusContentDecorator:
This decorator adds bonus content to a book, making the book slightly more expensive.
