msg = """realmont was under siege. the royal army, under henry ii of bourbon,prince of conde, had invested it at dawn wednesday, april 19, 1628. butthe huguenots, inside the battlements of the little town in southernfrance, were putting up a stiff defense. they cannonaded conde from atower and contemptuously rejected his demands that they surrender,saying that they would die instead. conde brought up five big cannonfrom albi, a dozen miles away, and on sunday ranged them in anominous line facing realmont.that same day his soldiers captured an inhabitant of the town whowas trying to carry an enciphered message to huguenot forces outside.none of conde's men could unriddle it, but during the week the princelearned that it might be solved by the scion of a leading family of albiwho was known to have an interest in ciphers.conde sent him the cryptogram. the young man solved it on the spot.it revealed that the huguenots desperately needed munitions and that, ifthey were not supplied, they would have to yield. this was news indeed,for despite the destruction of a number of houses by the catholicbatteries, the town was continuing to resist stoutly with no sign ofsurrender. conde returned the cryptogram to the inhabitants, and onsunday, april 30, 1628, though its fortifications were still unbreachedand its defenses still apparently adequate for a long siege, realmontsuddenly and unexpectedly capitulated. with this dramatic successbegan the career of the man who was to become france's first full-timecryptologist: the great antoine rossignol.when word of the incident reached cardinal richelieu, the astute andable gray eminence of france, he at once attached this useful talent tohis suite. rossignol proved his worth almost immediately. the catholicarmies under richelieu surrounding the chief huguenot bastion of larochelle intercepted some letters in cipher, which the young codebreakerof albi read with ease. he told his eminence that the starving citizenswere  eagerly awaiting help that the english had promised to send by sea. when the fleetarrived, the primed guardships and forts so intimidated it that it stoodoff the port's entrance and made no serious attempt to force a passage. amonth later, the city capitulated in full sight of the english vesselsâ€”andthe great french tradition of expertise in cryptology had been founded.rossignol very quickly established himself in the royal service. by1630, his solutions had made him rich enough to build a small butelegant chateau at juvisy, 12 miles south of paris, later surrounding itwith a charming informal garden designed by le notre, the gardener ofversailles. here louis xiii stopped to visit the young crypt-analyst in1634, 1635 and 1636 on his returns to paris from fontainebleau.in the swashbuckling court of that monarch, and then in theresplendent one of louis xiv, rossignol served with an extraordinaryfacility. the stronghold of hesdin surrendered a week sooner than itotherwise would have because he solved an enciphered plea for help, andthen composed a reply in the same cipher telling the townspeople howfutile their hopes were. how many other towns he compelled tosurrender, how many diplomatic coups he made possible, how manybetrayals he uncovered among the great nobles in those days of shiftingallegiances, he never discussed. this reticence caused some at the courtto charge that he never actually solved a single cipher, and that thecardinal spread inflated rumors about his abilities to discourage would-be conspirators. but in fact richelieu was frequently telling hissubordinates such things as, "it is necessary to make use, in my opinion,of the letters of the man who has been arrested by the civil authorities atmezieres, that is to say, have them put into rossignol's hands to see ifthere is something important in them." or, eight years later, in 1642,writing to messieurs de noyers and de chavigny: "i saw, in someextracts, that rossignol sent me, a truce negotiation of the king ofengland with the prince of orange; i do not think that it can have anyeffect, but ... it is up to you, gentlemen, to keep your eyes peeled."
