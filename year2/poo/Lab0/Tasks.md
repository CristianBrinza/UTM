# Lab 0: Environment Set Up

## Intro

In order to get the most smooth introduction in software engineering, it’s highly recommended to use a UNIX-like operating system. This laboratory work will help you get a comfortable basic setup & knowledge for implementing the following laboratory works.

## Tasks

Laboratory work consists of a few small steps to get your environment ready. Having these tasks done, you will be ready for Lab 1.

1. **Install a UNIX-based operating system.** The easiest way would be to install as dual boot one of the popular Linux distributions: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, maybe Arch if you suffer from insomnia.
It is important to install the OS, don't just use a virtual machine \
**Note:** Skip this step if you already use a Linux distribution or MacOS.

2. **Install essential tools.** You should install the “starting pack” of a software engineer on your machine. This includes zsh, oh-my-zsh, Git, gcc compiler, your favorite ide/editor.

3. **Create a Git repository.** Write a small hello-world program in C. Compile it using GCC and Make. Commit your changes and push them to your remote repository. \
**Perform all the manipulations with file system, source code compilation, git repository through command line exclusively**. Don't use graphical interfaces.

## Grading Policy

* **Task 1** *(5 points)*
    * **bonus:** having installed Arch Linux or Hackintosh *(1 extra point)*
* **Task 2** *(2 points)*
    * having `zsh` installed. *(1 point)*
    * having `oh-my-zsh` installed with custom configuration. *(1 point)*
* **Task 3** *(3 points)*
    * having published repository with source code, all manipulations done through command line. *(2 point)*
    * having Makefile script for compiling source code. *(1 points)*

## Presentation

Please, take screenshots during your work: setting up the OS, installing command line tools, initiating git repository, committing and publishing the changes in source code, compiling the code. Upload the screenshots into your previously created repository, and describe your work done in a `README.md` file. \
Send the links to your repositories to <alexandr.calugari@isa.utm.md> with subject including 'OOP Lab x' before the deadline.

## Deadline

**Time to complete:** _**1 week**_ since you receive the requirements \
_Each week_ of lateness will cost you minus _**1 point**_.

**Good Luck!**
